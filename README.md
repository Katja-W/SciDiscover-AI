# SciDiscover-AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

SciDiscover AI is an intelligent assistant designed for scientists and researchers. It automates the discovery, analysis, and synthesis of scientific literature from online databases, generating curated reading lists, article summaries, and identifying under-reported or promising research avenues for future research.


## Background

The core problem SciDiscover AI solves is the overwhelming volume of scientific literature that researchers face daily. Keeping up with new findings, identifying truly relevant articles, synthesizing information across multiple papers, and pinpointing genuine research gaps is incredibly time-consuming and often inefficient. This "information overload" is a universal challenge across all scientific disciplines, diverting valuable time from actual experimentation and analysis.

Problem: Scientists spend excessive time on literature review, leading to inefficiencies and potential missed discoveries.

Commonality: This problem is pervasive across all scientific fields and affects every level of researcher, from students to seasoned professionals.
Personal motivation: My motivation stems from the belief that AI can significantly improve the work of scientists by automating tedious data-intensive tasks, allowing researchers to focus on critical thinking, creativity and experimental design, thereby accelerating scientific progress.
Importance: By streamlining literature review and highlighting new research directions, this AI assistant can accelerate breakthrough discoveries and foster interdisciplinary connections.

## How is it used?

SciDiscover AI would function as a web-based platform or plug-in integrated into existing research environments.

Usage process:
A researcher enters a research question, specific keywords, an issue or even uploads an existing article of interest.
The AI processes the query, searches the relevant scientific online databases and retrieves a selected list of articles.
For each suggested article, the AI provides a concise abstract or summary.
The user can select specific articles for deeper analysis.
The AI then analyses the selected articles, identifying key themes, methodologies and findings.
Most importantly, it generates reports that highlight under-reported issues, potential contradictions or promising areas that require further research, effectively suggesting new research directions.

Situations and Users:
Environment: Primarily used in academic research labs, university libraries, R&D departments in industry, and potentially by professionals or analysts requiring evidence-based information.
Time: Used regularly (daily/weekly) during the literature review phase of any research project, from initial research to thesis writing or grant proposal development.
Users: Academic researchers (PhD students, postdocs, professors), R&D professionals, and anyone needing to quickly and comprehensively grasp a scientific topic.
Needs: Users need accuracy, speed, relevance, and the ability to uncover insights that might be missed through manual review. The interface should be intuitive and integrate seamlessly into existing workflows.

## Data sources and AI methods

The project's effectiveness heavily relies on access to vast and high-quality scientific literature.

Data Sources:
Academic Databases/APIs: IEEE Xplore, arXiv, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, etc. (access via APIs where available)
Open Access Repositories: CORE, etc.
Publisher Websites: Direct access to journal content (may require institutional subscriptions).
Full-text articles (PDFs): Essential for deep analysis beyond just abstracts.

AI Techniques:

Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Information Retrieval: For efficient searching and ranking of relevant articles.
Text Summarization: To generate concise and coherent summaries of articles. This would leverage advanced transformer models.
Semantic Search: To understand the contextual meaning of scientific text, enabling more intelligent and relevant search results.

Machine Learning/Deep Learning:
Clustering: Grouping similar articles or emerging research ideas.
Recommendation Systems: Suggesting articles based on user's reading history, identified interests, or the current research context.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Potentially for analyzing citation networks and identifying influential papers or emerging research fronts.

## Challenges

Every technological solution has limitations. SciDiscover AI will not solve:
Subjectivity of Research Value: While the AI can identify statistically less discussed topics or unusual connections, the true scientific value, feasibility, and ethical implications of "under-reported" or "worth extending" research ultimately require human scientific intuition, critical thinking, and experimental design capabilities. The AI can suggest, but not definitively decide.
Access to Paywalled Content: A significant practical limitation is obtaining full-text access to all relevant articles due to publisher paywalls and subscription models. The depth of the AI's analysis will be constrained by the data it can legally and practically access.
Nuance and Implicit Knowledge: AI models may struggle with highly nuanced interpretations, implicit knowledge, or subtle contradictions that human experts can infer from deep contextual understanding, especially in highly specialized or interdisciplinary fields.
Bias in Training Data: If the underlying training data (existing scientific literature) contains biases (e.g., favoring certain methodologies, regions, or research outcomes), the AI might inadvertently perpetuate these biases in its recommendations or analyses.
Real-time Updates: Maintaining a continuously updated knowledge base with the very latest scientific publications in real-time presents a substantial engineering challenge.
Hallucinations/Misinterpretation: Like any advanced language model, there's a risk of the AI "hallucinating" facts or misinterpreting complex scientific arguments, necessitating rigorous human verification of its outputs.

## What next?

SciDiscover AI has significant potential for growth and expansion:
Research Design: Going beyond the literature review to suggest experiments, studies and even assist in the initial phases of data analysis based on identified research gaps.
Collaboration: Implement functionalities that allow multiple researchers to use the AI collectively for group literature reviews, sharing identified insights, and collaboratively defining new research directions.
Personalized Learning & Skill Development: Tailor recommendations based on a researcher's specific sub-specialties, publication history, and even suggest relevant courses or potential collaborators to bridge knowledge gaps.
Cross-Lingual Research: Expand the AI's capabilities to analyze scientific literature published in multiple languages, breaking down language barriers in global research collaboration.
Grant Proposal/Paper Writing Assistance: Leverage the AI's ability to generate reports and identify insights to assist in drafting grant proposals or scientific papers, serving as a powerful co-authoring tool.
Predictive Analytics for Funding: Beyond suggesting research gaps, analyze emerging trends to identify areas likely to receive future funding or become major scientific breakthroughs.
